#Security Audit Bash Script

This is a bash script I created to automate basic system security checks. It's designed to be simple, fast and easy to use by making it perfect for students, sysadmins or anyone learning cybersecurity.

**What It Does Is**

Generates a security audit report with the current date in the filename (e.g., security_audit_2025-12-05.txt).
Collects important system information , user accounts and key logs.
Helps spot potential security risks on Linux systems.
Simple and efficient so anyone can run it anytime without hassle. 

**How to Make & Use the script**

1. Create a script new file by terminal
Use the code "nano security_audit.sh"
2. Save the file 
Use "Ctrl+O" press enter and click "Ctrl+X" to exit
3. Make the file executable 
use the code "chmod +x security_audit.sh"
4. Run the script in terminal
Use the code ./security_audit.sh
5. Check the report  
The script will create a file named like security_audit_(date).txt and it will contain the audit results.
